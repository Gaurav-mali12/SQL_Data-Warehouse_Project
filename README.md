# 🏗️ Data Warehouse Project (Bronze–Silver–Gold)


This repository contains a simple data warehouse implementation based on the Medallion Architecture. The project demonstrates how raw data from multiple source systems is processed through structured layers to produce business-ready datasets.

## 📖 Project Overview

The data warehouse is designed using three logical layers:

- **Bronze Layer**: Stores raw data ingested directly from source systems without transformation.
- **Silver Layer**: Contains cleaned, standardized, and validated data.
- **Gold Layer**: Provides curated, business-aligned data models for analysis and querying.

The architecture ensures clear data lineage, improved data quality, and scalability.

## 🗄️ Data Sources

The project uses data from the following systems:
- **CRM**: Sales transactions, customer details, and product information
- **ERP**: Product catalog, customer demographics, and location data

All source data is provided as CSV files.

---
## 🔄 Data Processing Flow

- Data is ingested into the **Bronze layer** as raw tables.
- The **Silver layer** applies cleansing, standardization, and enrichment.
- The **Gold layer** creates analytical structures such as fact and dimension tables.

This layered approach separates raw data handling from business logic and analytics.

## 📐 Data Modeling

- Fact tables store transactional data (e.g., sales).
- Dimension tables store descriptive data (e.g., customers, products).
- The final model follows a star schema optimized for analytical queries.
